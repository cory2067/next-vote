By leading Exec, I will aim to help residents achieve all the things they want to see in our dorm, be those new student groups, more food-centric social events, new communal cooking supplies, or more deep conversations. I will also aim to advance positive, constructive relationships with members of the MIT community who work in housing, dining, and student life, so that residents are happy with Next as an MIT dorm and as a dining dorm.

Having served on Next Exec as Housing Chair and working extensively on Next House projects such as the Next House website, social media, and swag, I gained intuition for communicating with Nexties and really enjoyed working with Nexties. I also discovered it was sometimes hard for Nexties to easily access updates on Next Exec projects, Next House clubs, and Next House Events. As VP Relations, I want to create an easily accessible platform for Nextizens to view progress on Next related projects (such as the makerspace). In addition, I will continue upkeeping the Next House calendar and move to include Next House club events in the calendar as well. And also I will work to continue maintaining close relations with groups in Next House, such as Next House clubs and peer mentors. It's these groups and projects created and supported by Nexties that help make up our incredible, unique culture and community. I hope to serve as your VP of Relations and support our Next House. <3"},

This past year, I’ve worked to uphold this necessity.

Continuing my role as secretary would allow me to further expand the responsibility so that I can make communication between Next Exec and all residents faster, clearer, and stronger.

Generations of amazing people have lived in this dorm, each with a unique perspective and story to tell. However, after graduation, many of these connections are lost. As Alumni Relations Chair for the past semester I have worked to explore ways to bridge this divide, examining alumni programs of the past to find what's worked, what hasn't, and what students both new and old are looking for out of Next House Alumni Relations. In addition to working to support several Next House projects such as Tech Twinkles and Country Kitchen reorganization, I have defined a set of core events and programs that I hope to implement as Alumni Relations Chair to improve the interface between current undergrads and undergrads of the past. The component of this plan that I am perhaps most interested in is an alumni dinner program through which Next House residents and Next House alumni will get the opportunity to sit down together, share a meal, hear advice, and swap stories. Through this and other initiatives I hope to enrich our community with the valuable heritage and perspective of prior-Nexties, while ensuring that it is preserved for future classes to come."}

One of my main goals is to improve the process of wing selection in freshman housing.
