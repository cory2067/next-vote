In the last two years I’ve enjoyed working with the house and exec as VP of Relations and Housing Chair and have found my passion is serving Next House. My goal as president will be to support Nexties in their endeavors. Be that pursuing facility improvements, new student groups, updating housing procedures and tools (such as the housing website), exciting social events (can we bring karaoke back?), or more snacks and swag. I also want to focus on keeping up transparent, constructive conversations both within our house and with MIT’s administration to ensure and improve Nexties’ experiences.

Over the past year and a half, I've served on Next Exec as both Publicity and JudComm chair, giving me an intimate understanding of the workings of Next House and Exec. My priorities as president will be using resident feedback to inform the process of creating the new makerspace, coordinating wing preference in the spring housing lottery, and collaborating with our treasurer to find ways to use our budget surplus sustainably. Outside of Next House, I'd also work to make Next's voice better heard by administration and campus-wide groups, such as Dormcon and the UA, by using my experience as a member of RingComm 2021. Together, let's make a better Next House for all of us!"}

As someone who has been on exec before as social chair, as well as being on the exec board for a number of student groups (Next Haunt, Next Big Thing, and Next Quest), I have had lots of experience working with Nexties to make cool things happen. As VP Rel, I want to continue this awesome tradition that Next House has. If a student group has a crazy idea of something big they want to do, I want to help them do it! If you and your friends want to make a project happen, we can work to do that too. Next House is a wonderfully creative place, and our student groups are where that creativity shines. I care so much about Next House and making sure that things happen -- you've probably seen me tirelessly working on Haunt, or running study breaks, or any number of other things I run around doing -- that, for my last year here, I want to be in charge of keeping it all going."}

That’s what I’ve loved about living here, and that’s also why I love getting the chance to talk with the alumni. For example, did you know that the first students of Next House referred to it as ‘the 500’ or that Next Exec in the early 2000s had a ‘rainy-day fund’ made up of $10,000 cash in a shoebox? I didn’t, not until I got the chance to talk to people who were there when these things happened, and that’s what makes the Alumni Relations position so cool. As Alumni Relations Chair, I’ve spent the past year trying to increase opportunities for students and alumni to interact, most notably the end-of year alumni gathering at Next House, which I hope will become an annual feature of our calendar. I’ve also been working behind the scenes with the Alumni Association to improve our capacity to reach out to alums, whether to invite them to events, ask them for money, or just let them know about what’s going on at the best dorm on campus. As Alumni Relations Chair I hope to continue this work, to bring Nexties new and old to the table to share their memories and learn from each other. There are so many amazing memories waiting to be told, and I would love the opportunity to help tell them."}

Previously, I worked to implement the triple tier system and developed the housing website – a web app to improve organization of the housing process and facilitate lotteries (such as with live updating maps).

Housing can be very stressful for many people, so the role of housing chair must be executed with as much transparency and clarity as possible. To this end, I made the map application that many of you used during the last upperclassman lottery when I was moving in (tiny.cc/nextlottery18). I definitely believe that the lottery process should better emphasize wing culture and give preference to in-wing moves (one way to do this is a wing-specific lottery), but I also think it is important that the lottery is not controlled or \"gamed\" by cliques of popular friend groups at the expense of individuals. As your housing chair I would be open to these and other ideas, and would look to settle disputes as quickly and efficiently as possible."}

In addition, I recognize the importance of encouraging and mediating conversations between different wings' wing reps, so one of my primary goals is to promote inter-wing study breaks that are entertaining and creative, creating a stronger community within the wings of Next. Therefore, as Judcomm Chair, I will be a dependable point of contact to answer questions about wing rep duties and will help generate and refine inter-wing as well as intra-wing study break plans.

Furthermore, as JudComm I will further empower Wingreps to serve their communities materially, emotionally, and mentally, which would help to accomplish my goal of improving the overall wellbeing of individuals in all the wings, and Next House by extension. Lastly, I believe my track record as housing chair shows that I’m great at executing my goals (such as with NEXTploration), being responsive to the needs of the house (displayed by proposing wing preference in response to a survey, and opening the discussion to the house to hear everyone’s opinion on the issue), and caring for Next house on a deep level, all traits I believe make me well suited for this position.
